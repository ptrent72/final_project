        <p>For over a decade, people have been coming to <a href="https://bryantpark.org/programs/juggling">Bryant Park</a> in midtown New York City to juggle! On their lunch break from work nearby, 
            after work on Tuesday or showing up on the weekends. People visit from different countries to juggle with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/BPJUGGLERS">this group,</a> or they might 
            be pulled in after just passing by before they're given some balls and proclaimed the "world's newest juggler" by the end of the night. </p>

        <p>For the rest of the summer, jugglers will be there having fun and ready to teach newcomers Monday through Friday at noon, along with Saturdays at 11 a.m. and Tuesdays at 5:30 p.m.</p>

                    <h3>Alex</h3>
                    <p>"So the Bryant Park Juggling Club, the way it came to be is that I always juggled near the place where I worked. And then was transferred to work uh one block from here in Bryant Park. 
                        And just kept doing what I’d normally done. Juggling in the park, just on my lunch break. 
                        In 2009 fall and spring 2010, people started joining me. And never ever stopped. 
                        We’ve uh issued almost 6,000 of these pins that say ‘I learned to juggle at Bryant Park.’ 
                        It’s this wonderful group of um of friends with a shared passion." </p>

                    <h3>Crystal</h3>
                    <p>"The regulars. Like there's a core group of people that are here every week, every Tuesday night regardless. And they're my friends, you get to know people, you get to have these good relationships. 
                        It's my juggle family."</p>

                    <h3>Jeff</h3>
                    <p>"There’s nothing better than the joy, and sometimes really surprise of people realizing that they can actually do this thing because so many people don't think that they can do it. 
                        There's a real mental block that a lot of people have towards this for some reason, I don't know why."</p>

                    <h3>Donnell</h3>
                    <p>"There’s a sense of freedom here that a lot of clubs don't have. I didn't have to learn five balls, 
                        but this place gave me the energy to sort of be able to work on that and whether I'm a five-ball juggler, or I can barely juggle over at all, it was never any different for how people treated me."</p>
