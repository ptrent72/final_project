        <p>Hundreds of people walked past or under the mural portraying Edward Said while heading to class or entering the bookstore.</p>

        <p> A second-year Palestinian student recalled looking at the Edward Said Mural almost everyday while walking around the 
            SF State campus. They remembered the contemplative gaze of the Palestinian academic portrayed in front of a background
            weaving a depiction of SF State’s Malcolm X plaza with iconic landmarks from New York City, Jerusalem and San Francisco. 
            Two cloud-like doves stand out in the bright blue sky, their intertwined figures spelling the word for “peace” in Arabic. </p>

        <p> “Something that brings me a lot of joy as a Palestinian on campus is the mural,” the student said, speaking on 
            the condition of anonymity. “Every time I see it, it just makes me happy that there’s something that’s a part of us 
            that is visible on campus.”</p>

                    <p>This line is taken from a poem that friend and fellow Palestinian writer, Mahmoud Darwish, dedicated to Said when he passed away. The line is written in English 
                    and Arabic calligraphy to speak in part of the experience Said — and many Palestinians have — of living in the diaspora. The three cities represented in this 
                    mural also represent that. Jerusalem, where Said was born, New York and Columbia University, where he lived for much of his life and taught at, and San Francisco, 
                    connecting to the place of the mural and more of the Palestinian diaspora.</p>

                    <p>Here in the mural are cactus trees that grow across Palestine. In Arabic, sabr means both the cactus fruit and patience. Because school administators censored 
                        the inclusion of Handala or the image of a key to symbolize Palestinian refugees right to return, the cactus trees are a way to connect both with the land in 
                        Palestine and the resilience of Palestinians.</p>
