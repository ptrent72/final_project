        <p>Hundreds of people walked past or under the mural portraying Edward Said while heading to class or entering the bookstore.</p>

        <p> A second-year Palestinian student recalled looking at the Edward Said Mural almost everyday while walking around the 
            SF State campus. They remembered the contemplative gaze of the Palestinian academic portrayed in front of a background
            weaving a depiction of SF State’s Malcolm X plaza with iconic landmarks from New York City, Jerusalem and San Francisco. 
            Two cloud-like doves stand out in the bright blue sky, their intertwined figures spelling the word for “peace” in Arabic. </p>

        <p> “Something that brings me a lot of joy as a Palestinian on campus is the mural,” the student said, speaking on 
            the condition of anonymity. “Every time I see it, it just makes me happy that there’s something that’s a part of us 
            that is visible on campus.”</p>

                    <h3>"I am from here, I am from there"</h3>
                    <p>This line is taken from a poem that friend and fellow Palestinian writer, Mahmoud Darwish, dedicated to Said when he passed away. The line is written in English 
                    and Arabic calligraphy to speak in part of the experience Said — and many Palestinians have — of living in the diaspora. The three cities represented in this 
                    mural also represent that. Jerusalem, where Said was born, New York and Columbia University, where he lived for much of his life and taught at, and San Francisco, 
                    connecting to the place of the mural and more of the Palestinian diaspora.</p>

                    <h3>Sabr</h3>
                    <p>Here in the mural are cactus trees that grow across Palestine. In Arabic, sabr means both the cactus fruit and patience. Because school administators censored 
                        the inclusion of Handala or the image of a key to symbolize Palestinian refugees right to return, the cactus trees are a way to connect both with the land in 
                        Palestine and the resilience of Palestinians.</p>

        <p>When presented the initial draft of the mural by students, administration representative Richard Giardina suggested creating a policy to equally allot space to all student 
            groups, saying that “problems could occur on campus” if other student groups opposed this mural. A subcommittee for the mural was approved in a 6-2 vote, with Giardina 
            voting against it.</p>

        <p> A week before the subcommittee planned to present its design to the main board, then-President Robert Corrigan wrote to the board, “The proposed mural is conflict-centered 
            … Its spirit is less of a celebration than of challenge. In short, it is at odds with the most fundamental values to which San Francisco State University is committed.”</p>

        <p> He asked the student board to send the design back to the arts committee rather than let it move forward. The board approved the design despite these concerns, and 
            Corrigan placed a moratorium on all murals until the board created a new mural allocation process that the president’s cabinet approved of.</p>

        <p> The initial design included Handala, a cartoon refugee child created by Palestinian artist Naji al-Ali, holding a pen in one hand and an old-fashioned key in the other. 
            Corrigan wrote that these images were “explicitly offensive and identified with an international conflict, rather than celebratory of the Palestinian-American experience and culture.”</p>
        
        <p>The key symbolizes the right of return for Palestinian refugees. Many Palestinian students in GUPS have been the grandchildren of those made refugees in the 1948 Nakba — the mass expulsion of Palestinians from their homes.</p>

        <p>“I know plenty of Palestinians who keep their deeds to their homes and their keys, and that’s what that is also about — going back home,” said Noel Madbak, a 2019 SF State graduate. “But supposedly it was never our home, 
            so I think it’s telling how threatening the key is. Because some people interpret the idea of us going home to mean we would kill them or go to war, but it shouldn’t have to be like that.”</p>
